               <h3>Importance of Visiting Patients</h3>
               <p>Family members and visitors are an important part of the healing process. Family members and visitors can not only support quicker recovery for patients, but can also help reduce anxiety and stress. We welcome respiratory symptom-free visitors and family members  and ask that you note our important visitor guidelines to help us maintain a healing environment.</p>
